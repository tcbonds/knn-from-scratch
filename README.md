# k-Nearest Neighbors Using Only NumPy
This repo corresponds to my article on Towards Data Science (soon to be published) about how to write k-NN from scratch. It contains functions for data preprocessing and the algorithm itself. The validity of the code is verified by comparing it's outputs to those of scikit-learn's KNeighborsClassifier().
